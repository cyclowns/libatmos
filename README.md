# libatmos

Rust library for creating atmospheric simulations for /tg/station SS13.

**Note:** This is just a backend. Programs such as atmos simulators or bomb calculators can be made very easily using this backend, but that's not what this does yet--it just provides a Rust API for all of the SS13 atmos datums and methods.

I'm planning on writing a GUI cross-platform desktop frontend and a WASM (web-based) frontend for bomb calculation and other goodies, so if you want that in the future, help contribute to libatmos!

Also, this could potentially be used in a TG-like SS13 remake if someone wrote one in Rust, but I doubt it.

## Contribution

> please contribute I would greatly appreciate it

See issues tab for more details. I try and add everything there that I'd like to work on in the near future.
